# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This C++ application challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number based on the chosen difficulty level. Players will receive feedback on their guesses and proximity hints, making the game more interactive and fun. The game also includes input validation and a replay option to continue the fun!

## Features
- **Difficulty Levels**: 
  - Easy: Guess a number between 1-10 (5 attempts).
  - Medium: Guess a number between 1-50 (7 attempts).
  - Hard: Guess a number between 1-100 (10 attempts).
  
- **Random Number Generation**: A random number is generated based on the selected difficulty level.
  
- **Guess Feedback**:
  - "Too low" if the guess is below the secret number.
  - "Too high" if the guess is above the secret number.
  - "Congratulations" if the guess is correct.
  
- **Proximity Hints**: 
  - "Very close" if the guess is within 10 of the secret number.
  - "Getting there" if within 20.

- **Input Validation**: Ensures the player's input is a valid number within the specified range.

- **Replay Option**: The game prompts the player if they want to play again after each game.
